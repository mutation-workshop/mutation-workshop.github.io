<p><span>Mutation is widely acknowledged as one of the most important techniques to
assess the quality of tests. In recent years, mutation has gained popularity
both in academia and research, with several companies and research projects
attempting to incorporate mutation to the development life cycle. Mutation
analysis has traditionally targeted the source code but has also been
successfully applied to various artefacts at different levels of
abstraction. Examples of such artefacts include: database schemas, finite state
machines, various model notations, security policies, software product lines,
etc. Mutation has also been employed to solve various research problems
including the Test Oracle Problem, Fault Localisation and Debugging, Defect
Prediction, etc. To this day, the mutation field continues to expand with an
increasing trend of high quality publications. The Mutation workshop aims
to be the premier forum for practitioners and researchers to discuss recent
advances in the area and propose new research directions. We invite submissions
of both full-length and short-length research papers and especially encourage
the submission of industry practice papers.</span></p>

<h2><a name=TOC-Types-of-Submissions></a>Types of Submissions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Three types of papers can be
submitted to the workshop:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li ><span>Full papers (10 pages):
     Research, case studies.</span></li>
 <li ><span>Short papers (6 pages): Research
     in progress, tools, experience reports, new ideas.</span></li>
 <li ><span>Industrial papers (6 pages):
     Applications and lessons learned in industry.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Each paper must conform to the
two columns <a
href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html"><span
style='color:#551A8B'>IEEE conference publication format</span></a>
and must be submitted in PDF format via <a
href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mutation2018"><span
style='color:#551A8B'>EasyChair</span></a>. Submissions will be evaluated according to the
relevance and originality of the work and to their ability to generate
discussions between the participants of the workshop. Three reviewers will
review each paper and all the accepted papers will be published as part of the
ICST proceedings.</span></p>
