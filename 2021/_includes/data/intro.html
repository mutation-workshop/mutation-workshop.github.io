                  <p><span>Mutation is widely acknowledged as one of the most
                      important techniques to assess the fault-revealing ability of tests. In recent years, mutation
                      has gained popularity both in academia and research, with several companies and
                      research projects attempting to incorporate mutation to the development life
                      cycle. Mutation analysis has traditionally targeted the source code but has also
                      been successfully applied to various artefacts at different levels of
                      abstraction. Examples of such artefacts include: database schemas, finite state
                      machines, various model notations, security policies, software product lines,
                      etc. Mutation has also been employed to solve various research problems
                      including the Test Oracle Problem, Fault Localisation and Debugging, Defect
                      Prediction, etc. To this day, the mutation field continues to expand with an
                      increasing trend of high quality publications.</span></p>

                 <p>Mutation 2021 is the 16<sup>th</sup> in the series of
                    international workshops focusing on mutation analysis. The
                    workshop will be co-located the 
                    International Conference on Software Testing, Verification,
                    and Validation (<a href="https://icst2021.icmc.usp.br/">ICST
                    2021</a>). Accepted
                    papers will be published as part of the ICST
                    proceedings.</p>

                <p>The Mutation workshop aims to be
                    the premier forum for practitioners and researchers to discuss recent advances in
                    the area and propose new research directions. We invite submissions of both
                    full-length and short-length research papers and especially encourage the
                    submission of industry practice papers.</p><br>
