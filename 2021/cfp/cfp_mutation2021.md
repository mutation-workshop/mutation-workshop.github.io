# CALL FOR PAPERS

Mutation 2021: The 16th International Workshop on Mutation Analysis

https://mutation-workshop.github.io/2021

Co-located with ICST 2021
(13th Intl. Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation)


## About Mutation 2021

Mutation analysis involves mutation of software artefacts that are then used to evaluate the quality of software testing tools and techniques. It is considered the premier technique for evaluating the fault revealing effectiveness of test suites, test generators and other testing techniques. 

Ideas derived from mutation testing have also been used to test artefacts at different levels of abstraction, including requirements, formal specifications, models, architectural design notations and informal descriptions. More recently, mutation has played an important role in software engineering for AI, such as in machine learning testing. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners have investigated diverse forms of mutation, such as training data or test data mutation, in combination with metamorphic testing to evaluate model performance in machine learning and detecting adversarial examples.


## Topics of interest

-  Evaluation of mutation-based test adequacy criteria, and comparative studies with other test adequacy criteria.
-  Formal theoretical analysis of mutation testing.
-  Empirical studies on any aspects of mutation testing.
-  Mutation based generation of program variants.
-  Higher order mutation testing.
-  Mutation testing tools.
-  Mutation for mobile, internet, and cloud based systems (e.g., addressing QoS, power consumption, stress testing, performance, etc).
-  Mutation for security and reliability.
-  Mutation for artificial intelligence (e.g., data mutation, model mutation, mutation-based test data generation, etc.)
-  Novel mutation testing applications, and mutation testing in novel domains.
-  Industrial experience with mutation testing.


## Submissions & Publication

Three types of papers can be submitted to the workshop:
- Full papers (10 pages): Research, case studies
- Short papers (5 pages): Research in progress, tools, experience reports
- Industrial papers (5 pages): Applications and lessons learned in industry
- Poster papers (2 pages): Reseach in progress, tools, problem descriptions, new ideas

Each paper must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication
[format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) and must be
submitted in PDF format via
[EasyChair]( ).
Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the
work and to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of
the workshop. Three reviewers will review each paper and all accepted papers
will be published as part of the ICST proceedings.

## Important Dates

- Submission of full papers: 10th January, 2021
- Notification of acceptance: 31st January, 2021
- Camera ready: 20th February, 2021
