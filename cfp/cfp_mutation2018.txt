CALL FOR PAPERS

Mutation 2018: The 13th International Workshop on Mutation Analysis
April 9, 2018, Västerås, Sweden

https://mutation-workshop.github.io/

Co-located with ICST 2018
(11th Intl. Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation)


* About Mutation 2018 *

Mutation is acknowledged as an important way to assess the fault-finding
effectiveness of test sets. Mutation testing has mostly been applied at the
source code level, but more recently, related ideas have also been used to test
artefacts described in a considerable variety of notations and at different
levels of abstraction. Mutation ideas are used with requirements, formal
specifications, architectural design notations, informal descriptions (e.g. use
cases) and hardware. Mutation is now established as a major concept in software
and systems V&V and uses of mutation are increasing. The goal of the Mutation
workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss new
and emerging trends in mutation analysis. We invite submissions of both
full-length and short-length research papers as well as industry practice
papers.


* Topics of interest *

- Mutation-based test adequacy criteria (theory or practical application).
- Mutation-based test data generation.
- Higher order mutation testing.
- Novel mutation testing paradigms and applications.
- Empirical studies of mutation testing.
- Formal theoretical analysis of mutation testing.
- Comparative studies (i.e., studies that compare mutation with other
  techniques).
- Mutation testing tools.
- Industrial experience with mutation testing.
- New mutation systems for programming languages and for higher-level
  descriptive.
- Increasing the efficiency of mutation. 
- Mutation for mobile, internet and cloud based systems. 
- Mutation for security and reliability.


* Submissions & Publication *

Three types of papers can be submitted to the workshop:
- Full papers (10 pages): Research, case studies
- Short papers (6 pages): Research in progress, tools, experience reports,
  problem descriptions, new ideas
- Industrial papers (6 pages).

Each paper must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication format
(https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
and must be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/
conferences/?conf=mutation2018). Submissions will be evaluated according to the
relevance and originality of the work and to their ability to generate
discussions between the participants of the workshop. Three reviewers will
review each paper and all accepted papers will be published as part of the ICST
proceedings.


* Important Dates *

- Submission of abstracts: January 5, 2018
- Submission of full papers: January 12, 2018
- Notification of acceptance: February 19, 2018
- Camera Ready: February 28, 2018
- Workshop date: April 9, 2018
